## VP Quick Search

This is a small web application so you can parse Pinata data faster than pouring over notes or a PDF. You can search pretty much by any term, "bluebell seed", "Gardener", "corn" ect. I made this solely out of furstration, so I hope it helps you too lmao. I plan to do some major refactors and add more features.

## TODO

- combine flutterscotches into one object
- seperate out components
- add some form of tracking
- add some logic for tracking
- updaate the README to actually have better information
- make sure its mobile compatible
- do some restyling to make it look cleaner and easier to read
- probably serve it somewhere outside of github pages
- add icons for each pinata
